===============


Celery: Distributed Task Queue
-----------------------------------

Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing. It is focused on real-time operation, but supports scheduling as well.

The execution units, called tasks, are executed concurrently on a single or more worker servers using multiprocessing, Eventlet, or gevent. Tasks can execute asynchronously (in the background) or synchronously (wait until ready).


sh: Python subprocess interface
------------------------------------

像调用一个函数那样去执行系统的命令，非常cool。


SimpleCV: The Open Source Framework for Machine Vision
----------------------------------------------------------

SimpleCV is a framework for Open Source Machine Vision, using OpenCV and the Python programming language.

It provides a concise, readable interface for cameras, image manipulation, feature extraction, and format conversion. Our mission is to give casual users a comprehensive interface for basic machine vision functions and an elegant programming interface for advanced users.


pandas: powerful Python data analysis toolkit
------------------------------------------------

pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.


gevent: Coroutine-based concurrency library for Python
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Fast event loop based on libev.
- Lightweight execution units based on greenlet.
- Familiar API that re-uses concepts from the Python standard library.
- Cooperative sockets with SSL support.
- DNS queries performed through c-ares or a threadpool.
- Ability to use standard library and 3rd party modules written for standard blocking sockets


pySerial
---------------

This module encapsulates the access for the serial port. It provides backends for Python running on Windows, Linux, BSD (possibly any POSIX compliant system), Jython and IronPython (.NET and Mono). The module named "serial" automatically selects the appropriate backend.


Requests: HTTP for Humans
----------------------------


Watchdog
--------------

Python API and shell utilities to monitor file system events


web.py
---------

web.py is a web framework for Python that is as simple as it is powerful
